# MinVR

MinVR is an Open Source Project developed and maintained collaboratively by the University of Minnesota, Macalester College, and Brown University.

The goal of MinVR is to facilitate a variety of data visualization and virtual reality research projects by providing a robust, cross-platform VR toolkit for use with many different VR displays (e.g., CAVE's, PowerWalls, multi-touch stereoscopic tables, 3DTV's, head-mounted displays) and input devices (e.g., 6 degree-of-freedom trackers, multi-touch input devices, haptic devices, home-built devices).



## Quick Start Guide

### Prereqs

MinVR is built using the cross-platform CMake tool.  Before building MinVR, you will need to install CMake version 3.9 or higher (https://cmake.org/).  


### Background for CMake Beginners

If you are new to CMake, this is the minimum background you should have before building MinVR.

CMake is a cross-platform tool for generating native Unix Makefiles and project workspaces (e.g., Xcode projects, Visual Studio solutions) for building projects.  Projects use CMakeLists.txt files to describe how they should be built.  These files provide input for the cmake application, which uses them to generate project files for a variety of development environments.  CMake can generate Makefiles for building MinVR on linux systems or project files for building MinVR with popular IDEs (e.g., XCode, Visual Studio, Eclipse, CodeBLocks).  

There are three versions of the cmake application that are provided with the install from Kitware.  You can use any of these with MinVR:
1. *cmake* is the command line version where all build options must be specified on the command line.
2. *ccmake* is a visual interface that runs in a terminal.  This is nice because all of the available build options are listed for you to see at once, and you can simply press the SPACEBAR to turn them on/off or type in specific values.  The downside for ccmake is that it does not have a separate log window, so status messages flash by so fast that you cannot read them, and input from spin-off cmake processes (like those used in the MinVR configure step) are not captured correctly.  It's possible to still use ccmake with MinVR, but we do not recommend it.
3. *cmake-gui* is an OS-specific windowed version.  Like ccmake, the GUI provides a useful list all of the available build options.  Unlike ccmake, it also includes a nice scrollable log of all of the status messages.  So, this is the preferred version for new users and for the first time you build a project.

With CMake, it's best to do an out-of-source build.  That means that when you start CMake you must tell it two paths: 1. the path to the MinVR source tree, AND 2. the path to the place where you would like all the built files to be created.  When running cmake-gui, these can be set interactively with a file selection dialog, but all three versions respond to command line options, and this is generally the easiest way to start up cmake.  So, we suggest starting *cmake-gui* from the command line.  First cd to the directory you wish to use for the built files, then pass a single required command line argument for the path to the MinVR source tree.  Usually, you will see this written as a series of 3 steps -- the common idiom for cmake builds:
```
# from within the root of the project's source directory
mkdir build
cd build
cmake-gui ..
```

In addition to the path to the root source directory, you can pass a variety of other options to CMake on the command line.  If you are using *cmake* this is the only way to set important flags such as -D WITH_PLUGIN_GLFW=ON, to tell MinVR to build optional plugins.  So, with *cmake*, you will typically end up with a long string of arguments in order to setup the build you want.  With *cmake-gui*, you can set all of these build options within the user interface.


### Download, Configure, Build, and Run a Test Graphics Program

Here's a complete annotated list of steps to display your first MinVR demo program.

#### 1. Download the MinVR Source Tree
```
git clone http://github.com/MinVR/MinVR
```

#### 2. Create an Initial CMake Build Configuration

```
cd MinVR
mkdir build
cd build
cmake-gui ..
```

Press the 'Configure' button. Then, select the Generator you would like to use from the list provided (e.g., Xcode, Visual Studio, Unix Makefiles).  Click Done.

Wait for CMake to do an initial configuration.  This will populate an initial list of CMake and MinVR build options.  Each time you run configure, *cmake-gui* will display any new configuration options highlighted in *red*.  So, do not be alarmed when the whole options window turns red during this first configure operation -- that is normal behavior since at this point, all of the options are new.

Scroll through the options to confirm that ```AUTOBUILD_DEPENDENCIES``` is preset to ```ON```.  The main MinVR library does not depend on other external libraries, but several MinVR plugins do have dependencies.  The first time you build MinVR, it is useful to have ```AUTOBUILD_DEPENDENCIES``` set to ```ON``` because this will cause MinVR to automatically download, build, and install any dependencies that are needed by the plugins if they are not already found installed on your system.

Also check the important variable ```CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX```.  If you decide the install MinVR on your system, this is the location where cmake will do that.  For example, for a system-wide installation on a linux system, you could set this to ```/usr/local```.  

```CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``` is also used as the path for installing any dependencies that MinVR builds when ```AUTOBUILD_DEPENDENCIES``` is ```ON```.  Note that if ```AUTOBUILD_DEPENDENCIES``` is ```ON``` and a Plugin or other optional build requires them, the dependencies are downloaded, built, and installed during the MinVR *configure step* (i.e., before even building MinVR).  This means that if you want to also install the dependencies on your system, it is important to set ```CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``` now, not just later if you eventually decide to install the MinVR library itself.  


#### 3. Select Plugins to Build and Re-Configure

Plugins and all other optional portions of the MinVR build (e.g., examples, documentation) can be turned on using options of the form ```WITH_*```.  Scroll down to those options now.  Let's build an example of a first 3D graphics program that can run in a desktop mode or VR mode.

Set ```WITH_ITEST_OPENGL_SHADERPIPELINE_WITH_API``` to ```ON```.  This will build the itest-opengl-shaderpipeline-with-api example application.

We also need to build two plugins.  If you search for *itest-opengl-shaderpipeline-with-api* in cmake-gui's output textbox, you'll see that there is a note that says that that this execuatable requires the OpenGL Plugin and a WindowToolkit Plugin, such as the GLFW Plugin.  (The FreeGlut Plugin could be used in place of GLFW if desired.)  Let's build the two required/recommended plugins:

Set ```WITH_OPENGL_PLUGIN``` to ```ON```.

Set ```WITH_GLFW_PLUGIN``` to ```ON```.

Now, click the Configure button again.  (In CMake, you need to re-configure every time you make a change to a build option.  Sometimes a change will also unlock new options.  It doesn't hurt to try different options and reconfigure as many times as you want or to keep pressing Configure until no new options (in red) appear -- that way you know you have seen every available option.


#### 4. Generate the Build System / Project Files

Finally, with these options set, press the Generate button.  This is the step that will actually generate the Unix Makefiles, Visual Studio Solution File, or Xcode Project File needed to build MinVR.  


#### 5. Build MinVR with the Specified Options

Click Open Project if you generated project files for an IDE, or if you generated Unix Makefiles return to your shell and the build directory.  Now, build the project as you normally would in these enviornments.  

For Xcode or Visual Studio ```click the triangle button```.

For Unix Makefiles ```type make```.


#### 6. Run a Test Program in Desktop Mode

```bin/itest-opengl-shaderpipeline-with-api -c ../config/desktop.minvr```

or as a shorthand that will load the ```desktop.minvr``` config file that ships with MinVR 

```bin/itest-opengl-shaderpipeline-with-api -c desktop```

or as an even shorter shorthand that will load the ```default.minvr``` config file that ships with MinVR, which is also a desktop environment:

```bin/itest-opengl-shaderpipeline-with-api```


#### 7. Run in VR Mode

You can run the same example application in a variety of VR displays supported by MinVR just 
by changing the configuration file specified on the command line.  MinVR ships with configs 
that work for some common displays, such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and various 3DTVs.  
If you have a Vive, try running the following.

```bin/itest-opengl-shaderpipeline-with-api -c HTC_Vive```

MinVR also works with high-end displays, such as CAVEs and Powerwalls.  Some example config 
files for these environments are also included, but these high-end environments are not 
standardized, so these may writing a custom config file using one of the examples as a 
starting point.


## Installing the Library

CMake will generate an install target that you can run to install MinVR on your system.  The installation follows a linux convention:

- Utilities, tests, other binaries: ```<CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>/bin```
- MinVR library: ```<CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>/lib/MinVR-2.0```
- MinVR header files: ```<CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>/include/MinVR-2.0```
- MinVR config files for pre-defined VR Setups: ```<CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>/share/MinVR-2.0/config```
- CMake Config Package for including MinVR in other projects: ```<CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>/lib/cmake/MinVR-2.0```
- MinVR plugin shared libraries: ```<CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>/lib/MinVR-2.0```
- MinVR plugin .dlls (windows only): ```<CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>/bin/MinVR-2.0```
- MinVR plugin header files: ```<CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>/include/MinVR-2.0/<PLUGINNAME>```
- Autobuilt dependencies: following their own install conventions inside ```<CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>```

After setting ```CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``` and configuring, install MinVR by running:
```make install``` 
for Unix Makefiles.  Or build the 
```install``` 
target from within your IDE.


## The CavePainting-Lite Example, Copy and Write Your Own VR Programs that you can Debug in Desktop Mode

*Prereq:* Before getting started, make sure you have installed MinVR.  If you are not ready to install it system-wide, it's fine to just install it to the default location at ```MinVR/build/install```, but it needs to be installed somewhere in order for apps outside of the MinVR build system to find it.

The projects in the MinVR/examples folder are examples of stand-alone projects that use separate build systems.  They can be copied and moved out of the MinVR source tree to serve as starting points for building your own project.

To get started, either copy examples/CavePainting-Lite to a new directory so you can modify it to create your own app or work directly in that directory.

If you do copy the example to a new location, you'll need to edit the top line of CavePainting/Lite/CMakeLists.txt to point to the prefix where you installed MinVR.

Now, build using the same cmake process as before:
```
cd examples/CavePainting-Lite
mkdir build
cd build
cmake-gui ..
```
Then, *Configure* and *Generate* to produce project files for your IDE or makefiles.  Finally, build CavePainting-Lite within your IDE or by running ```make```.

Now, you can run the CavePainting-Lite app in desktop mode:
```
./CavePainting-Lite
```
or in VR mode, for example:
```
./CavePainting-Lite -c HTC_Vive
```

In desktop mode, MinVR's builtin "Fake Trackers" are used to translate mouse and keyboard input into the same style of 6 degree-of-freedom VR tracker move events that real VR trackers would generate.  The advantage of this approach is that you can write your apps assuming that VR input will be available and then fake this input when debugging on a desktop.

Here are the CavePainting-Lite controls for both Desktop and VR modes:

| Function                           | Desktop Mode                       | VR Mode                            |

|   - Toggle Brush Tracker On/Off^1  | Keyboard '2'                       |                                    |

|   - Toggle Hand Tracker On/Off^1   | Keyboard '3'                       |                                    |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|

|   - Look Around                    | Mouse Right Click and Drag         |                                    |
|   - Walk Forward/Backward          | Keyboard 'UP'/'DOWN' or 'W'/'Z'    |                                    |
|   - Turn Left/Right                | Keyboard 'LEFT'/'RIGHT' or 'A'/'S' |                                    |
|   - Toggle Head Tracker On/Off^2   | Keyboard '1'                       |                                    |

^1 The reason to toggle the paintbrush and hand trackers on/off is so that you can control one at a time.  Since we need two trackers but we only have one mouse, both "fake trackers" follow the mouse.  In VR, this would be like having both hands right on top of each other.  If you want to test a technique where there is some distance between the hands in desktop mode, then you can toggle on/off the trackers to move them separately.

^2 There is really no reason to need to turn the head tracker on/off in this app.  The toggling feature is built in to the way that MinVR implements fake trackers.

## Using the MinVR API

You can create your own MinVR application using the interface provided in the ```api``` directory by subclassing from ```VRApp```.  Here is the simplest example code:

```
#include <MinVR.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class MyVRApp : public VRApp {
public:
    
    /** The constructor passes command line args to VRApp so that MinVR config files and options can be parsed.
     */
    MyVRApp(int argc, char** argv) : rHandDown(false) {}
    virtual ~MyVRApp() {}

    /** USER INTERFACE CALLBACKS **/
 
    virtual void onAnalogChange(const VRAnalogEvent &event) {}
    
    virtual void onButtonDown(const VRButtonEvent &event) {}
    
    virtual void onButtonUp(const VRButtonEvent &event) {
    	if (event.getName() == "RHandBtn_Down") {
    		rHandDown = true;
    	}
    	else if (event.getName() == "RHandBtn_Up") {
    		rHandDown = false;
    	}
    }
    
    virtual void onTrackerMove(const VRTrackerEvent &event) {
        if (event.getName() == "RHand_Move") {
            memcpy(rHandTrans, event.getTransform(), sizeof(float) * 16);
        	std::cout << event.getName() << " "
    		          << event.getPos()[0] << " " << event.getPos()[1] << " " << event.getPos()[2] 
    		          << std::endl;
        }
    }
    
    
    /** RENDERING CALLBACKS **/
    
    virtual void onRenderGraphicsScene(const VRGraphicsState& state) {
    	// for this simple example, change the background color when the right hand button is depressed
        if (rHandDown) {
        	glClearColor3f(0.7, 0.7, 0.7);
        }
        else {
        	glClearColor3f(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);
        }
    	glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT | GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT);

    	// try drawing a cube at the location of the right hand with whatever functions your graphics library
    	// here's an example with old-school opengl + glut
    	float *projMatrix = renderState.getProjectionMatrix();
    	float *viewMatrix = renderState.getViewMatrix();
    	float *modelMatrix = rHandTrans;

	    glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
    	glLoadMatrixf(projMatrix);

    	glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
		glLoadMatrixf(viewMatrix);
		glMultMatrixf(modelMatrix);

		glutSolidCube(1);
    }
    
    virtual void onRenderGraphicsContext(const VRGraphicsState& state) {}

private:
  float rHandTrans[16];
  bool rHandDown;
};   

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        MyVRApp app(argc, argv);
        app.run();
        return 0;
}
```

## Overview and Philosophy of the Project

MinVR is an Open Source Project developed and maintained collaboratively by the University of Minnesota, Macalester College, and Brown University.

The goal of MinVR is to facilitate a variety of data visualization and virtual reality research projects by providing a robust, cross-platform VR toolkit for use with many different VR displays (e.g., CAVE's, PowerWalls, multi-touch stereoscopic tables, 3DTV's, head-mounted displays) and input devices (e.g., 6 degree-of-freedom trackers, multi-touch input devices, haptic devices, home-built devices).

Informed by our collective experience with a variety of VR research platforms in the past decade, the approach is to create an as-minimal-as-possible (hence the name MinVR) library that at its core contains the key code necessary to support head-tracked stereoscopic VR on a variety of displays and with a variety of input devices.  But, to have this core written in a generic way that does not impose a dependency on application programmers to use specific display or input hardware or even a specific 3D graphics library.  Of course, every VR program requires some graphics, so the library also supports this, but this support along with support for specific input devices is implemented outside of the core using a plugin architecture.  In summary, the core has essentially no external dependencies and is designed to be common to all VR programs and support for specific graphics toolkits, input devices, and other non-essential features are all implemented in plugins.

The rationale for this design comes from our experiences with VR programming over the years.  Some key points follow:

Remove the dependency on a specific graphics toolkit:  One of our key insights is that different projects often require different graphics toolkits.  At the UMN, we have used raw OpenGL and glut, G3D (versions 8, 9, and 10), Open Scene Graph, VTK, OpenHaptics, and Unity3D for recent projects depending upon the type of data we wish to visualize.  To support this, we have had to many times rewrite core VR support routines (e.g., calculating projection matrices for head-tracked displays, reading data from VR input devices, synchronizing multiple rendering nodes on a network).  Although they are often programmed this way (we have always done it this way in the past), these routines do not actually need to depend upon a particular graphics library. We think MinVR may be the first VR toolkit to specifically try to remove this dependency and support multiple graphics toolkits.  

Support both HMDs and Caves:  Existing VR toolkits seem to either target the games industry via support for low-cost head-mounted displays or the high-end scientific visualization community via support for synchronized rendering on a computer cluster.  We use both styles of VR displays in our research, so would like a VR toolkit that supports both.  MinVR is designed to support both low-cost head-mounted displays and high-end VR environments, such as Caves and Brown University's amazing new YURT.

Support multi-threaded rendering:  This is becoming important to support as new machines with multiple GPUs become more common, but it is quite difficult to introduce the idea of multi-threaded rendering into a VR toolkit unless it was designed with this idea from the beginning.  We have worked extensively with the VRG3D library, for example, but could not identify a good way to modify that library to support multi-threaded rendering on our newest high-end computer with 4 graphics cards.

Support VR research:  This is an overarching principle.  We do strange things in our research :), such as combining multi-touch with VR displays, wiring up custom input devices, streaming data to VR from supercomputers, etc.  This tends to mean that we need full access to the source code for our VR toolkit, and that we need flexibility.  The VREvent class in MinVR is a good example.  Today, the most common VR input events come from 3D trackers and buttons, but in the future, VR may rely much more heavily on depth cameras, microphones, and yet-to-be-invented input devices.  That's why the data payload for each VREvent is defined so generically.  This, again, is in contrast to many existing VR toolkits, which make key assumptions about what input is available in a VR app, e.g., every VR app has a head position, a left hand position, and a right hand position.  Developing a convention like this to support hardware and software developers as they try to promote a new VR games industry is probably a good idea for that industry, but from the standpoint of VR research that strives to discover new modes of human-computer interaction, this type of convention can be quite limiting.

Easy to get started and to modify existing graphics programs to support VR:  We often work with students who need to be able to get started programming a VR application in a week, not a whole semester.  We also have many existing 3D graphics programs that we would like to run in VR.  This motivates having a minimal and simple API for application developers.  The VRMain class contains just 4 big functions that need to be added to an existing graphics program in order make it VR capable.  And, to create a new application, programmers just fill in two callback routines, one for handling user input, and one for drawing 3D graphics.
