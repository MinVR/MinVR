/// If you use them with the handy-dandy \#defines here, you'll also

/// as where it happened, of course), and maybe even the function
/// name, depending on your compiler.
///
/// Usage:
///
///   VRERROR("Syntax error.", "You might have spelled the name wrong.");
///
/// If you don't like providing advice, or if it's not at all clear
/// what advice would be relevant, you can also do this:
///
///   VRERRORNOADV("Syntax error.");
///


// We can get the file, line, and function name from the pre-processor.
