/// \brief A dynamically-typed data store.
///
///  This class implements a VRDataIndex, a flexible structure that stores
///  multiple data fields as key=value pairs, like an associative array, but
///  with several significant enhancements.
///
///    - Multiple types -- in C++ it is a challenge to create an associative
///      array where the data stored in the array can be any type.  VRDataIndex
///      addresses this by supporting an extensible set of core types defined
///      in VRCoreTypes.h.  Unlike in C++ *values* have type, but *names* do
///      not.
///
///    - Hierarchical scoping -- One of the data types in the VRDataIndex is a
///      "container", comparable to a struct, that contains other data values,
///      potentially including other containers.  The containers define a
///      "namespace" or a "scope" and the same name may appear within multiple
///      containers.  Inner namespaces inherit all of the fields defined in
///      outer namespaces.  When data are accessed from an inner namespace,
///      locally defined data fields override outer fields with the same name.
///
///    - Serialization -- The entire data index, or some piece of it, can be
///      read from and written to an XML file format, for ease of passing over
///      a network.
///
///    - State -- The entire data index state can be preserved by pushing it
///      onto a stack, and later restored by popping that stack.
///
///  MinVR reports event and render state information to API users via
///  VRDataIndex objects. VRDataIndex is also used extensively inside MinVR,
///  including to store data read in from config files.  Users can create their
///  own VRDataIndex objects if they wish.
///
///  VRDataIndex objects store a collection of data fields as key=value pairs
///  where the keys are std::strings and the values can be any of the MinVR
///  core types defined in VRCoreTypes.h.  An important data type is the
///  "container", a struct, more or less, that defines a "namespace" or
///  "scope" for a data field name.
///
///
///  ## Hierarchical Scoping
///
///  Unlike standard associative arrays, the key string can include the name
///  of a container holding some data.  Think of the data values as existing
///  inside one of a collection of nested containers.  You name the container,
///  and then the value inside it, and you can specify the whole thing by
///  specifying the container name, appended with a slash (/) and the data
///  field name.  Containers and the namespaces they define constitute an
///  inheritance hierarchy used for data lookups.  You'll recognize the
///  namespace concept from C++, and the way the inheritance works is similar
///  to how global and local variables work in C++, too:
///
///    ~~~
///    // Global scope
///    int width = 10;
///    int height = 10;
///
///    void extraWideWindow() {
///      // Defining width in this local function overrides access to global width
///      int width = 20;
///      // Accessing width and height from within the local function picks up the
///      // global version of height and the local version of width
///      cout << width << ", " << height << endl;  // prints 20, 10
///    }
///    ~~~
///
///  An analogous example using a VRDataIndex looks like this:
///    ~~~
///    VRDataIndex index();
///
///    // Default case: windows are a 10 x 10 square
///    index.addData("Width", 10);
///    index.addData("Height", 10);
///
///    // There is also a special case of an extra wide window.  The width
///    // changes but all other window settings are the same.
///    index.addData("ExtraWideWindow/Width", 20);
///
///    // Here's how to retrieve data for the default window case
///    int wdefault = index.getValue("Width");
///    int hdefault = index.getValue("Height");
///
///    // Here's how to retrieve data for the extrawide window case
///    int wwide = index.getValue("ExtraWideWindow/Width");
///    int hwide = index.getValue("ExtraWideWindow/Height");
///    ~~~
///
///  There are two important guidelines to note in this example:
///
///    - First, to add or get data from within a container, simply include the
///      container name (the namespace) within the key passed to the addData() and
///      getValue() functions.  Separate the container and the data field name
///      with /'s.  There is no limit to the depth of nesting.
///
///    - Second, notice in the last two lines of the example that *both* lines
///      request data from the ExtraWideWindow namespace even though Height was
///      never defined there.  This is because Height (and any other common
///      window settings) will be automatically inherited.  This is a common
///      usage pattern since VRDataIndex objects are often used for configuring
///      displays that have many common settings but some variation (e.g.,
///      multiple projectors that are part of a large display wall).
///
///  When working with a data index that might hold many default values and a
///  few special cases, remember to:
///
///   1. To avoid duplicating data, put as much common data as you can within
///      the root level -- the global namespace,
///
///   2. Override values in local containers as needed, and
///
///   3. When retrieving the data, use the namespace defined by the container
///      to access your data.  This will allow you to take advantage of the
///      inheritance feature.
///
///  If you do this, then your code should only need to know which namespace to
///  use, not which specific data fields change from one special case to the
///  next.
///
///
///  ## Storing your own classes in VRDataIndex
///
///  The MinVR core types were selected with the idea that most data structures
///  commonly used in VR apps can be stored in one or a combination of core
///  types.  For example, a 3D point, vector, quaternion, or 4x4 transformation
///  matrix can all be stored in a std::vector<float>, and the data index
///  supports a VRFloatArray type to encapsulate that.
///
///  If you use your own C++ classes for points, vectors, matrices, or other
///  objects you would like to store in a VRDataIndex, you can extend your
///  classes to make them nicely compatible with VRDataIndex by following these
///  two steps: (1) Make your class implement one of the VR*Convertible
///  interfaces defined in VRCoreTypes.h.  This will allow the data index to
///  convert your class's data into a core type can can be stored in a the
///  index.  (2) Implement a constructor that takes the corresponding core type
///  as an argument. If you do these two things, then you can use the data
///  index with your class as follows:
///    ~~~
///    MyClass m1;
///    dataIndex->addData("MySpecialKey", m1);
///    //...
///    MyClass m2 = dataIndex->getData("MySpecialKey");
///    ~~~
///
///  ## XML Representation
///
///  A VRDataIndex can read/write itself or a subset of itself to an XML
///  format.  Each named data field is represented as an XML element where the
///  XML start tag and end tag are the data's name and the content of the
///  element describes the data.  Here is an example that uses a variety of
///  core types to store data fields associated with a touch input event:
///    ~~~
///    <SensorName type="string">MultiTouchTablet</SensorName>
///    <TouchID type="int">1</TouchID>
///    <Speed type="float">1.025</Speed>
///    <PixelPosition type="intarray">100, 125</PixelPosition>
///    <NormalizedPosition type="floatarray">0.5, 0.65</NormalizedPosition>
///    <Modifiers type="stringarray">Shift,Ctrl,Alt</Modifiers>
///    ~~~
///  The `type=` attribute is an optional directive for the parser.  It would
///  have been fine to leave it out of the example above because the type can
///  be inferred from the content in all but extreme cases (e.g., a string that
///  contains only numbers).
///
///  Containers are also represented as XML elements.  The start tag and end
///  tag use the name of the container (and thus the namespace of the contained
///  objects).  Container elements contain child elements, which can be either
///  other container elements or data elements.
///
///  The XML parser used here is based on the "Simple C++ XML Parser" from the
///  CodeProject article by "BratilaRazvan", 2010.
///  see: http:///www.codeproject.com/Articles/111243/Simple-Cplusplus-XML-Parser
///  It does not currently support entities, or CDATA declarations.
///
///
///  ### Serializing an Entire Index
///
///  When an entire VRDataIndex is serialized, the index's name is used for the
///  start and end tags, and all the root-level containers and data appear as
///  children of that top-level. The extrawide window example from above would
///  be represented as:
///    ~~~
///    <MyWindowSettings type="container">
///        <Width type="int">10</Width>
///        <Height type="int">10</Height>
///        <ExtraWideWindow>
///            <Width type="int">20</Width>
///        </ExtraWideWindow>
///    </MyWindowSettings>
///    ~~~
///
///  ### Using XML Attributes
///
///  In addition to the `type=` attribute, which is reserved for internal use,
///  user-defined attributes can also be set and retrieved.  This feature can
///  be used to tag data values that you wish to easily retrieve later.  For
///  example, if you set an attribute of `nodeType="WindowNode"` for all of the
///  WindowNodes stored in your index, then you can easily retrieve a list of
///  all entries that represent WindowNodes by calling
///    ~~~
///    index->selectByAttribute("nodeType", "WindowNode");
///    ~~~
///  Aside from this "tagging for ease of later retrieval" feature, which is
///  most often used as a way to write cleaner XML config files, attributes are
///  not intended to be used to store significant data values, since this is
///  the job of the rest of the data index.  Only std::string values are
///  supported for attribute values.
///
///  For the most part, the data index is agnostic about attributes.  You are
///  in charge of naming them and retrieving them.  However, there is one other
///  special attribute, a "separator" attribute used to define the serialized
///  representation of array data.  It works like this:
///    ~~~
///    <cora type="intarray">3,4,5,6</cora>
///    <nora type="stringarray" separator="@">A string@B sting@C sing@D sin@E in@F i</nora>
///    ~~~
///  If no separator is specified, the default is a comma ','.  You can use
///  backslash (\) to include a separator character in one of the strings.  So:
///    ~~~
///    <cora>Alpha,Beta,Gamma\,Delta,Epsilon</cora>
///    ~~~
///  Comes out with four entries in the array, "Alpha", "Beta", "Gamma,Delta",
///  and "Epsilon".  See indextest.cpp for an example.
///
///
///
///  ## More about Containers and Namespaces
///
///  To use the data index effectively, it is useful to understand the concept
///  of a namespace, or scope.  If you don't want to bother, just remember
///  this: a namespace is just a container's name, with a '/' after it.  The
///  rest is just detail.
///
///  Containers define a namespace as well as hold a bunch of objects inside
///  them.  The two are very closely related, but are conceptually distinct.
///  From a user's point of view, a namespace is a string that starts and ends
///  with a '/' and may or may not have some text in the middle.  Here are some
///  possible namespaces:
///     ~~~
///     /perry/
///     /freida/mary/
///     /     <- the root namespace to which all VRDataIndex objects belong.
///     /homer/henry/martha/
///     ~~~
///  As with a Linux directory, a data value might be specified with a complete
///  name, such as /homer/henry/martha, or as a relative name, 'martha' defined
///  relative to the /homer/henry namespace.
///
///  A container object is simply an object that "contains" other values.
///  Those objects can be core data types, or they can also be other
///  containers.  The container object contains a list of the (relative) names
///  of the objects it contains.  Here is a possible container:
///     ~~~
///     | peter
///     | | harold
///     | | norma
///     | | flora
///     ~~~
///  This corresponds to an index that contains these names:
///
///     ~~~
///     /peter
///     /peter/harold
///     /peter/norma
///     /peter/flora
///     ~~~
///
///  Note that the container lists the relative name.  When the container is
///  serialized, the serialized version contains only the relative names.
///
///  ## Usage
///
///  To use a VRDataIndex, create an object of that class.  You can use the
///  default constructor, which will give you an empty index with the default
///  name of "MVR", ready for action.  You can also use a constructor that
///  accepts a serialized data index as an XML-encoded string, which loads the
///  data into the index, ready to go.  The root name of the serialized string
///  will become the name of the data index object, and the children of that
///  root name will be at the root level of the data index.
///    ~~~
///    VRDataIndex *m = new VRDataIndex();  // Gets you an empty index.
///
///    // The following will create an index named 'a' containing
///    // data values 'b' and 'c', both integers
///    VRDataIndex *m = new VRDataIndex("<a><b>3</b><c>5</c></a>")
///    ~~~
///  Some other examples of serialized XML data, ready to become VRDataIndex
///  values:
///    ~~~
///    <flora type="int">42</flora>
///
///    <bob type="container">
///       <flora type="int">42</flora>
///       <pi type="float">3.1415926</pi>
///    </bob>
///    ~~~
///  You can add values to the index in one of three ways.
///
///   1. With the addData() functions.  These take a name and a value and park
///      them in the index.  The addData() with a single name argument adds a
///      container of that name and you can subsequently add items to it.
///
///   2. Feed some serialized data to the addSerializedValue() functions.  This
///      is just XML-encoded string data, such as is output by serialize().
///
///   3. Feed a file containing XML into processXMLFile().  There is no
///      validation of the XML done, and there are some ways in which this is
///      not an arbitrary XML parser.  For example, the parser assumes
///      uniqueness of names within an element.  Two elements of the same name
///      within some parent element will overwrite one another.  Validation of
///      the XML is left to some other process, hopefully with a schema that
///      enforces this limitation.
///
///  Once an index has entries, they can be retrieved at your pleasure with
///  getValue() and serialize().  The getValue() method returns an object that
///  can be used directly in your program.  The casts are built into the
///  function via a helper class, so long as the compiler can figure out the
///  appropriate type to convert to.  So (int)p->getValue() gets you an integer
///  and (float)p->getValue() gets you a float. (So long as the relevant
///  objects actually contain an integer and float, otherwise you get an
///  error.)
///
///  To use, do this:
///    ~~~
///    VRDataIndex *index = new VRDataIndex;
///    int a = 4;
///    index->addData("/george", a);
///    ~~~
///  This incorporates an integer value of 4 into the index with the name
///  "george" that appears at the root (global) level.
///
///  When you want to refer to the value you put in, do this:
///    ~~~
///    int p = index->getValue("george");
///    ~~~
///  or
///    ~~~
///    int p = index->getValue("george", "/");
///    ~~~
///  Where the second argument is the "namespace", which is arranged
///  like a directory structure, with slashes (/) separating the names.  You
///  can also do this:
///    ~~~
///    std::string s = index->serialize("/george")
///
///    VRDataIndex *newIndex = new VRDataIndex;
///    newIndex->addSerializedValue(s);
///    int b = newIndex->getValue("/george");
///    ~~~
///  The b variable now contains the same value as a, with the same name.
///
///
///  There is an exercz.cpp file that does an ok job of illustrating some of
///  the usage.  You'll find it filed under "interactive tests" as the
///  config-viewer.  You can run that program to learn about the namespace and
///  name scoping concepts.  It's sort of like an interpreter for some
///  primitive language environment whose only functions are assigning
///  variables and reading them.
///
///  The system encompasses the VRDataIndex class, whose job it is to track a
///  set of names and corresponding VRDatumPtr objects, smart pointers to
///  VRDatum objects, that hold a type and value.  There is also a
///  VRDatumFactory object, whose only use is creating the specializations of
///  the VRDatum object for each of the supported data types.  It's all meant
///  to be as portable as possible and not rely on any external libraries.  It
///  uses an XML reader, see those files for the original credit.

  /// nested containers.  If you don't want to deal with the inheritance
  /// feature, use the inherit argument to turn it off.

// Where are we going with this: We have an index that contains
// pointers to more-or-less arbitrary data types, yay.  On the to-do
// list:
//
//   - Write the serialize method, at the VRDatum level, where
//     it only encodes the value, and at the VRDataIndex level,
//     where you add the type description (also from VRDatum),
//     the name (from the index) and the value. [DONE]
//
//   - VRDatum constructors that work from the serialized form
//        int george 6
//         ^    ^    ^
//         |    |    |
//         |    |    handled in VRDatum
//         |    handled in VRDataIndex
//         handled in VRDataIndex (choice of Datum specialization) [DONE]
//
//   - Add the interpreters to VRDataIndex to read the whole
//     serialized form and invoke the appropriate VRDatum
//     constructor. [DONE]
//
//   - Add a string data type to check on the add instructions. [DONE]
//
//   - Add the struct data type, a collection of primitive data types,
//     or other structs.  The data inside the VRDatum for this
//     container type is just going to be a vector of map iterators,
//     pointing at map entries in the main index. (I think) [DONE]
//
//   - Make testindex into an examination tool.  'p variable' for
//     print its value and serialization, 'p' for print everything,
//     etc. [DONE]
//
//   - 'c name' for adopting a namespace, 'a string' for add a
//     variable to store, etc. [DONE]
//
//   - Need to support name conflicts by either overwriting the new
//     value or throwing an exception or some other way of defending
//     the old value.  User should be able to choose. [DONE]
//
//   - Support nested names in the index, with "default directory"
//     functionality.
//
//        - Need a getName(key, nameSpace) [DONE]
//        - Leave getValue, getDescription, and serialize as they were,
//          needing a fully-qualified name as input. [DONE]
//        - They can all have second forms that have a nameSpace, but
//          call the original under the covers. [DONE]
//
//     Needs to handle blank namespaces, and ignore the namespace for names
//     that begin with a slash. [DONE]
//
//   - Should be ready to work with the XML parser for entire files at
//     this point. [DONE]
//
//   - Add the vector types, and whatever else.  Boolean?
//        vector<float> [DONE]
//        matrix<float> [TBD]
//
//   - Make the parser infer data types where possible, rather than relying
//     on the type attribute. [DONE]
//
//   - Add container typedef to VRDatum [DONE]
//
//   - Add helper class to VRDatum, implement getValue() [DONE]
//
//    - Do something about VRDatum setValue() methods? Maybe
//      comparable to the virtual getValue() methods? [NO, Users should not use]
//
//   - change VRDataIndex::getValue() to getDatum() [DONE]
//
//   - Can we add a helper class to data index? [DONE]
//
//   - Need a human-readable and a machine-readable (i.e. quicker)
//     format for serialization. [DONE]
//
//   - The mvrTypeMap is clunky and is not attached to the VRDatum
//     description field.  The mapping between type ID and description
//     should appear only once, somewhere. [DONE]
//
//   - Improve (and test) adding values to containers. [DONE]
//
//   - The walkXML should look out for linkNode attributes, so we can skip
//     the linkNodes() and linkContent() steps of deserialization. [DONE]
//
//   Need to simplify the process of adding data types.
//
//   - Make CreateVRDatum functions into templates?
//
//   - Make VRDatumPtr::intVal(), etc, into templates.
//
//   - After those are done, the VRDataIndex::addData() methods can
//     probably be template-ized, too.
//
//   - An audit of all the calls might be good, to look into
//     reference-izing anything that is actually called by value and
//     shouldn't be.
//
//   - getDatum() should be private.  Add attribute handling methods to the
//     data index, and the VRDatum type can be completely hidden. [DONE]
//
//   - We are adding a "list" of index objects.  These are an ordered
//     collection of VRDataIndex objects, all with more or less the
//     same name, but differentiated by index.  They can be as motley
//     a collection of objects as you care to try to manage, but
//     managing them is your problem.  We will refer to this as an
//     "imaginary" type called VRList.
//
//     This is implemented by redefining the data index typemap to
//     point to a std::vector of VRDatumPtr objects.  It will require
//     some extra parsing of an index name, but that's all.  Hardest
//     part is the semantics of reading stuff in -- overwrite or just
//     add to list?
//
//     Will need:
//
//       - Add std::vector<VRDatumPtr> to the typemap instead of
//         VRDatumPtr.
//
//       - Make work for single element sets.
//
//       - Provide some parsing aids to look for subscripts on the
//         ends of names.  Perhaps names are no longer a string, but a
//         string and a subscript value struct?
//
//       - Probably need a couple of management aids, like a size()
//         method and something like an iterator.
