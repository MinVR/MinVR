/// \brief A queue of MinVR events.
///
///
/// This object maintains a queue (FIFO) of serialized "event" objects,
/// ordered by a timestamp.  Events, which are just small VRDataIndex
/// objects, are pushed onto the queue, examined, and popped off.  You can
/// serialize a queue, preparing it to be sent across a network, and you can
/// also add the contents of one queue to another and have all the events
/// come out in the right time order.
///
/// The system is meant to support network operations -- where the entire
/// queue is sent across a network and therefore must be serialized -- as
/// well as threaded operation, where no network and no serialization are
/// necessary.  Thus the queue is a map between timestamps and objects that
/// can contain either a std::string of serialized data or a pointer to a
/// VRDataIndex object.
///
/// Use this queue for sending data to some other process, or receiving
/// it.  The transmission format is the same XML format as in the
/// VRDataIndex description.
///
/// Note that the queue supports both serialized data and raw data.  If you
/// add serialized data to the queue, it will remain serialized until you
/// ask for it with getFirst().  If you add raw data (in the form of a
/// VRDataIndex object (a/k/a VRRawEvent), it will remain raw data, unless
/// the queue is serialized for transmission over the network.
