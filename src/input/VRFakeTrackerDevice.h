/** A "virtual input device" that converts mouse and keyboard events into 6
    Degree-of-Freedom tracker events.  This facilitates debugging VR programs
    on a desktop computer.  You can set up any number of devices, with
    different names.  The events will be issued as <name>_Move events.  So if
    your fake tracker is called "Head", it will issue "Head_Move" events.  A
    keyboard event is nominated to turn on and off the various trackers.

    There are four different modes enabled: XY translate, Z translate, XY
    rotate and Z rotate.  While in a mode, mouse movements control the
    rotation or translation.

    The tracker is chosen and modes are set and unset using keyboard events,
    which are all configurable.  The keys can be configured to be toggles,
    where pressing the key enters the mode and pressing it again exits, or as
    states, where the mode is only enabled while the key is pressed.  There
    are also scale factors you can set to adjust the sensitivity of the
    tracker to mouse movements.

    To operate in 'sticky' mode, press the toggleOnOff key, then use the
    translateEvent (default: 'w'), translateZEvent (default: 'z'),
    rotateEvent (default 'r'), and rollEvent (default: 'e') keys to change
    modes of operation.  The mouse will move the tracked object accordingly.
    To operate in non-sticky mode, hold down the relevant key while moving
    the mouse.

    The rotations and translations happen in a 'Seeker' mode, or a 'Looker' mode.
    In a head-tracked context, the 'Seeker' mode is what you would use to explore
    a landscape.  When translating, the mouse movements move the position in the
    horizontal plane, more or less, or up and down.  In the 'Looker' mode, the
    same mouse movements move the viewer in a vertical plane, or forward and
    back.  In the 'Seeker' mode, the horizontal rotations spin the viewer, while
    in the 'Looker' mode, they spin the viewer around the origin.
