# GLFW does export a cmake config package, but it doesn't seem to be setup correctly to work
# with imported targets.  So, the MODULE flag to find_package() below is critical -- it forces
# cmake to use our FindGLFW.cmake script rather than the glfwConfig.cmake package installed
# with GLFW.  If they fix their glfwConfig.cmake package at some point, then we can upgrade
# to just using the generic version of AutoBuild_use_package()



# Usage:
# AutoBuild_use_package_GLFW(
#    # The 1st argument is required.  It is the name of the target you wish to link this dependency to.
#    my-program 
#
#    # The 2nd argument is required.  It impacts how dependencies are propogated through CMake.  You can treat
#    # this dependency as an INTERFACE, PUBLIC, or PRIVATE.  See CMake's docs on Imported Targets for details.
#    PUBLIC 
# )
