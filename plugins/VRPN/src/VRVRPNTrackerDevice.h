	Calibration Procedure:

	1. Set TrackerUnitsToRoomUnitsScale to get everything in feet.

	2. Adjust DeviceToRoom by printing out the position of sensor 0
	until it reports the origin of RoomSpace in the correct place and
	+X, +Y, and +Z all point in the correct direction.  You can print
	out the value of sensor 0 by calling printSensor0(true).

	3. Use the TestTrackers function of the IS3D/programTemplate demo
	to draw the CoordinateFrame for each tracker.  Adjust each
	tracker's PropToTracker transformation until it aligns itself with
	the RoomSpace frame when the tracker is held at the origin of
	RoomSpace.

	Here's an easy way to think about it: Hold up each prop at the
	origin of RoomSpace in the orientation that you want to be
	considered "normal".  Then, look at the drawing of its frame.  For
	each of the vectors in its frame (X,Y,Z) that are shown, ask
	yourself, what is the RoomSpace vector that this arrow depicts?
	Then enter that value in the appropriate X,Y, or Z column in the
	PropToTracker frame.

	4. For some of the props you may want the origin for the prop to
	be somewhere on the prop other than where the tracker is
	positioned.  For these, measure the distance from the tracker to
	where you want the origin to be, call this vector V.  Then, put
	this vector into the translation part of the PropToTracker frame.
	Be careful, the translation is applied after the rotation
	specified in the frame, so for example, if the first column of the
	frame is (0,1,0,0), you should put the Y component of V in that
	column, so it would become (0,1,0,Y[1]).  If it were (0,-1,0,0),
	you would need to put (0,-1,0,-Y[1]).
